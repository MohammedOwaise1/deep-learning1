Deep learning introduction
1. deep learning is define about to working on complex neural networks.this topic is subset of the machine learning.
types of layer:
1. Input layer;
   receives the raw data to the machine
2. hidden layer:
   perform the computations in the hidden layer which is process the data
3.Output layer:
   provide the final output and prediction on classification


Activation functions in deep learning:

1.ReLU : Rectified linear unit:
which is used to hidden layer to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simple used to speed up during the training of the data.
2.sigmoid:
map the value binary (0 and 1 in the layer).
3.softmax:
convert the raw data (score) convert into the propability on the given data.

back propogation an doptimisationn:

in ths propogation step we use some of the example -mse(means standard error),cross entropy stop: which are optimises the
